# License (AGPL-3.0)

Understanding the AGPL license and what it means for using and contributing to Bifrost Integrations.

---

Bifrost Integrations is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

## What is AGPL?

The AGPL is a strong copyleft license that ensures the software remains open source and available to everyone. It's similar to the GPL license, but with one critical addition: it requires source code disclosure even when the software is offered as a network service.

To ensure this platform remains open and available to everyone. If you modify and deploy Bifrost, you must share those modifications with the community. This prevents proprietary forks and ensures improvements benefit everyone.

## What You Can Do

  
    You can use Bifrost Integrations to run your Integration Services business, charge customers, and make money. The license doesn't restrict commercial use.
  

  
    You can modify the code to fit your needs, add features, fix bugs, and customize the platform however you want.
  

  
    You can deploy Bifrost on your own infrastructure, in your cloud, on-premises, or anywhere else you choose.
  

  
    You can redistribute the software to others, as long as you maintain the same license terms.
  

## What You Must Do

If you deploy a modified version of Bifrost Integrations (including running it as a service for yourself or others), you must:

1. **Share Your Modifications**
   - Make your modified source code available to users
   - Include the same AGPL license
   - Document your changes

2. **Preserve Copyright Notices**
   - Keep all existing copyright and license notices
   - Add your own copyright for your modifications

3. **Provide Access to Source**
   - Make it clear how users can access the source code
   - Include build and installation instructions

The key difference between GPL and AGPL: **if users interact with your modified version over a network** (like a web app or API), you must offer them access to the modified source code. This prevents "SaaS loopholes" where companies modify open source software but never distribute it.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Using Bifrost As-Is

**You deploy Bifrost without modifications and use it for your Integration Services business.**

- ✅ This is perfectly fine
- ✅ You don't need to share anything (you haven't modified it)
- ✅ You can charge your customers for your services

### Scenario 2: Modifying for Internal Use

**You modify Bifrost and deploy it for your own company's use.**

- ✅ You must make your modifications available
- ✅ Users who access your deployment must be able to get the source
- ✅ You can still charge for your Integration Services

### Scenario 3: Creating a Custom Feature

**You build a new workflow type or integration and deploy it.**

- ✅ You must share the modified platform code
- ⚠️ Your workflows themselves are yours (they're not part of the platform)
- ✅ You can keep proprietary workflows private if you want

### Scenario 4: Offering Bifrost as a Service

**You offer a hosted version of Bifrost to other MSPs.**

- ✅ You must provide your modified source code to users
- ✅ You can charge for hosting, support, and services
- ❌ You cannot create a proprietary fork and hide your changes

## What's NOT Covered by AGPL

  
    The workflows you create using Bifrost are yours. They're not derivative works of the platform. You can keep them private, sell them, or do whatever you want with them.
  

  
    Custom integrations you build for specific APIs or services are yours. You don't have to share them unless they modify the core platform.
  

  
    All data you process through Bifrost belongs to you and your customers. The license only applies to the code, not your data.
  

## Why This License Protects You

The AGPL ensures that:

1. **You can't be locked out** - If the original maintainers abandon the project, you have the code
2. **Improvements are shared** - Everyone benefits from enhancements, not just one company
3. **No proprietary forks** - A big company can't take Bifrost, modify it, and lock everyone out
4. **Community stays strong** - All contributors know their work will remain open
