# Permissions & Roles

Bifrost uses a simple role-based system to control who can access workflows and forms.

## User Types

### Platform Admins

Platform administrators have full access to:

-   Manage all users and roles
-   Configure platform settings
-   Access all workflows and forms
-   View audit logs

**Assign to:** System administrators and platform maintainers only

### Regular Users

All other users are regular users who can be assigned roles that determine what they can access. Users can always access their own execution results.

## Custom Roles

You can create custom roles to control access to specific workflows and forms. Roles are flexible and can be assigned to:

-   **Users** - Control which forms a user can access
-   **Forms** - Restrict which users can submit a form (based on their assigned roles)

### Creating Roles

Roles are simple labels like:

-   HR
-   Finance
-   POC

Assign these roles to users in the user management interface.

## Using Roles with Forms

When creating a form, you can restrict access by role:

1. **Create roles** for your team (e.g., `hr_team`, `finance_approver`)
2. **Assign roles to users** in the user management interface
3. **Set form permissions** to require specific roles
4. **Users without the role** won't see or be able to submit the form

**Example:**

-   Create a role: `Expense Approver`
-   Assign it to your managers
-   Set your "Approve Expense" form to require `Expense Approver` role
-   Only managers can now approve expenses

## Best Practices

### Start with No Roles

When first creating workflows and forms, start without role requirements. Add role restrictions only when you need to:

-   Protect sensitive operations (like deleting data or approving expenses)
-   Limit access to specific teams
-   Separate duties (different roles for creation vs approval)

### Use Descriptive Role Names

Choose role names that clearly describe the team or permission:

```markdown
# Good role names

"Finance"
"Expensive Approvers"
"HR"

# Unclear role names

"Role 1"
"Group A"
"Special Users"
```

### Keep It Simple

Don't over-complicate your role structure:

-   Start with a few roles (3-5 for most organizations)
-   Add more only when needed
-   Avoid creating a role for every single workflow

Note: Platform admins can always execute workflows regardless of role requirements.
