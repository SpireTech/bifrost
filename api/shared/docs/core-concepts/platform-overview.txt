# Platform Overview

Understanding Bifrost's architecture and core concepts

---

Bifrost Integrations is an open-source automation platform designed to democratize best-in-class tooling for the emerging Integration Services industry - before venture capital gets the chance to own something we're all incredibly passionate about: solving problems with automation.

## What Bifrost Solves

Existing RPA platforms are great for rapid development and provide helpful abstractions for things like OAuth, but **they cannot and will not keep pace with AI-powered development** and have always been constrained by limitations that traditional programming languages do not have.

Bifrost Integrations removes those limitations by creating a light management layer with the features that make RPA's uniquely valuable and letting Python do what it's good at. It's architected with multi-tenancy at its core, enabling you to scale your Integration Services business without duplicating work across customers. **This is not another RPA tool trying to be everything to everyone**; it's a platform designed specifically to help you build scalable automation businesses the right way, without vendor lock-in, and without the limitations of RPA.

    Microsoft CSP) - Abstract authentication, pagination, and API complexity -
    Share functionality across all your workflows

{" "}

    - Automated OAuth refresh flows - Key/value configuration storage per
    organization - Encrypted secrets storage

{" "}

## Core Concepts

### Workflows

Python async functions decorated with `@workflow`:

```python
@workflow
async def create_user(email: str, name: str):
    """Create a new user in the system."""
    return {"user_id": "123"}
```

The decorator auto-infers name, description, and parameters from your function. These workflows are automatically discovered and can be tied to forms, scheduled jobs, and webhooks.

### Forms

UI for workflows with:

-   Multiple field types
-   Data provider integration for dynamic lists
-   Visibility rules
-   Real-time validation

### Data Providers

Dynamic options for dropdowns:

```python
from bifrost import data_provider, context

@data_provider(name="get_departments")
async def get_departments():
    org_id = context.org_id  # Access via proxy if needed
    return [
        {"label": "Engineering", "value": "eng"},
        {"label": "Sales", "value": "sales"}
    ]
```

### Workflow Discovery

Workflows are discovered automatically when the API starts:

1. Scans workspace files (stored in S3, synced locally)
2. Imports Python files with `@workflow` and `@data_provider` decorators
3. Registers metadata in the database
4. Exposes via REST API

When you edit files in the UI editor, changes are pushed to workers via RabbitMQ, keeping all instances in sync. This enables you to organize your code by feature, customer, or whatever you find most useful.

## Multi-Tenancy

-   **Organization Isolation**: Context provides information about who the caller is so you can make decisions in your code
-   **Org-Scoped Secrets**: Stored as configurations, configs and secrets will default to the caller's organization first and call back to global secrets with the same name.
-   **Forms**: Forms are essentiall how you expose workflows in a user-friendly way and can be scoped to an organization. Today, form configuration exists in the database and is designed in the UI.

## Security

-   **Authentication**: Local auth, Microsoft, Google, or any OIDC provider
-   **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to forms
-   **Secret Management**: Encrypted secrets stored in PostgreSQL
-   **Audit Logging**: Most actions logged with user context
-   **OAuth Flow**: Secure OAuth 2.0 token management with automatic refresh

## Use Cases

### MSP/IT Service Providers

-   Ticket automation
-   Service request forms

### Enterprise IT

-   Multi-system user provisioning
-   Self-service capabilities
-   Bulk operations via forms
-   Line-of-business app integration

### Integration Services

-   Data synchronization
-   Event-driven workflows
-   API orchestration
-   Custom business logic
