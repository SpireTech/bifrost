# For the Non-Developer

How AI coding tools make Bifrost accessible to those without traditional programming backgrounds.

---

With AI coding tools, proper instructions, a thriving community, and training, it's never been easier to build powerful automations. Traditional RPA tools still require you to understand programming primitives like loops, variables, and conditional logic - they had their own syntax you needed to learn.

While Bifrost Integrations may require a slightly higher initial investment to get started, the combination of AI-assisted development and a platform that abstracts the dangerous complexities (authentication, secrets management, API security) means **the ceiling is dramatically higher**.

    The platform handles the hard parts - OAuth flows, credential encryption,
    multi-tenant isolation, and API authentication - so you can focus on solving
    business problems.

## AI Tools Can Help You

AI tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and GPT Codex can help you:

  
    Describe what you want in plain English, and AI tools can generate the Python code for you.

    "Create a workflow that pulls users from Microsoft Graph and creates tickets in HaloPSA"

  

  
    When something goes wrong, AI tools can explain the error message and suggest fixes.

    They can even identify common mistakes and show you the corrected code.

    AI can review your code and suggest better ways to structure it, handle
    errors, or improve performance.

  
    Common patterns like pagination, error handling, and API calls can be auto-generated so you don't have to write them from scratch.
  

## Traditional RPA vs. Bifrost with AI

### Traditional RPA Tools

**Pros:**

-   Visual interface (drag and drop)
-   Lower initial learning curve
-   Quick to get started

**Cons:**

-   Proprietary syntax you must learn
-   Limited by platform capabilities
-   Expensive licensing as you scale
-   Can't keep pace with AI-powered development
-   Vendor lock-in

### Bifrost + AI Tools

**Pros:**

-   Use real Python (more powerful, more flexible)
-   AI helps you write code from descriptions
-   Modern development tools (VS Code, Git)
-   Open source (you control it)
-   Scales without per-user licensing costs
-   Access to the entire Python ecosystem

**Cons:**

-   Slightly steeper initial learning curve
-   Need to understand basic programming concepts
-   Requires familiarity with command line tools

    **The key insight:** Traditional RPA tools still require you to understand
    loops, variables, and conditional logic - they just use their own syntax.
    With AI assistance, you can learn real Python while AI helps with the syntax
    and structure.

## Getting Started as a Non-Developer

1. **Install the Right Tools**

    - VS Code (code editor)
    - Claude Code or GitHub Copilot (AI assistant)
    - Git (version control)

    [See Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation)

2. **Learn Basic Python Concepts**

    You don't need to be an expert, but understanding these basics helps:

    - Variables (storing data)
    - Functions (reusable code blocks)
    - Async/await (handling multiple tasks)
    - Error handling (what to do when things fail)

    **With AI:** You can ask your AI tool to explain these as you encounter them

3. **Start with Examples**

    Bifrost includes example workflows. Copy one, modify it with AI help, and see what happens.

4. **Use AI to Learn**

    When you see code you don't understand:

    - Ask AI to explain what it does line by line
    - Ask "why is this structured this way?"
    - Request alternative approaches

    **Example prompts:**

    - "Explain what this workflow does in simple terms"
    - "How would I modify this to also create a Teams message?"
    - "What does the `@workflow` decorator do?"

## Real-World Workflow Development

Here's how you might build a workflow with AI assistance:

### Example: Onboard New User

**Your description to AI:**

> "I need a workflow that creates a new user in Microsoft 365, adds them to specific groups based on their department, creates a mailbox, and sends a welcome email with their credentials."

**AI generates:**

```python
from bifrost import workflow

@workflow(category="User Management")
async def onboard_user(
    email: str,
    first_name: str,
    last_name: str,
    department: str
):
    """Onboard new user to M365 with groups and welcome email."""
    # AI generates the implementation
    # with proper error handling, logging, etc.
    pass
```

The decorator automatically infers name (`"onboard_user"`) and description from the docstring. Parameters are extracted from the function signature with proper types. Data providers for dropdowns (like departments) are configured in the form builder.

**Then you can ask:**

-   "Add error handling for when the user already exists"
-   "Log each step to the execution logs"
-   "How do I test this locally before deploying?"

## What You Can Build

With the right guidance and AI assistance, you can build automations that would have required a full development team just a few years ago:

  
    Onboarding, offboarding, role changes - all automated across multiple platforms
  

{" "}

    Monitor usage, reclaim unused licenses, automate assignments based on
    department

{" "}

    Auto-create, update, or close tickets based on events from monitoring tools

{" "}

    Gather data from multiple sources, generate reports, deliver to stakeholders

{" "}

    Connect platforms that don't normally talk to each other

  
    Build forms that let users request services without opening tickets
  

## The Reality Check

**Will you write perfect code on day one?** No.

**Will AI make mistakes?** Sometimes.

**Will you need to learn?** Yes.

**Is it worth it?** Absolutely.

The combination of:

-   Real programming power (Python)
-   AI assistance (Claude Code, Copilot)
-   Platform abstractions (OAuth, secrets, multi-tenancy)
-   Open source freedom (no vendor lock-in)

...means **the ceiling is dramatically higher** than traditional RPA tools, and the path to get there is more accessible than ever before.

    Begin with simple workflows (create a user, send an email) and gradually
    build more complex automations as you learn. AI tools help you bridge the
    gap between simple and complex.
