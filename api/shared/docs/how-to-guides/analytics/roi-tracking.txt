# ROI Tracking

Track time saved and value generated by workflows

---

Track the return on investment (ROI) of your automation by measuring time saved and value generated.

## Overview

Bifrost tracks ROI metrics for each workflow execution:

- **Time saved**: Minutes saved per execution
- **Value**: Dollar value of time saved
- **Aggregation**: Daily, weekly, monthly rollups

## Configure Time Saved

Add `time_saved` to your workflow decorator:

```python
from bifrost import workflow

@workflow(
    time_saved=15  # Minutes saved per execution
)
async def onboard_user(email: str, name: str):
    """Onboard a new user - saves 15 minutes vs manual process."""
    await create_accounts(email, name)
    await send_welcome_email(email)
    return {"status": "onboarded"}
```

Estimate time saved by measuring how long the manual process takes, then set that as `time_saved`.

## How ROI Is Calculated

For each workflow execution:

1. **Time saved** = configured `time_saved` value
2. **Value** = time saved × hourly rate ÷ 60

Platform admins configure the hourly rate in settings.

## Viewing ROI Reports

Navigate to **Reports** > **ROI** to see:

- **Total time saved**: Across all workflows
- **Total value**: Dollar value generated
- **By workflow**: Breakdown per workflow
- **By organization**: Per-org metrics
- **Trends**: Daily/weekly/monthly charts

## Example Report

| Workflow | Executions | Time Saved | Value |
|----------|------------|------------|-------|
| onboard_user | 150 | 37.5 hrs | $1,875 |
| sync_tickets | 1,200 | 10 hrs | $500 |
| generate_report | 60 | 5 hrs | $250 |

## Best Practices

### Accurate Estimates

Measure actual manual process time:

```python
# Measured: manual user creation takes ~20 minutes
@workflow(time_saved=20)
async def create_user(email: str):
    ...

# Measured: manual data entry takes ~5 minutes per record
@workflow(time_saved=5)
async def import_record(data: dict):
    ...
```

### Complex Workflows

For workflows with variable time savings:

```python
@workflow(
    time_saved=30,  # Average case
    description="Process invoice - saves 20-45 minutes depending on complexity"
)
async def process_invoice(invoice_id: str):
    ...
```

### Track High-Value Workflows

Focus time_saved on workflows that replace significant manual effort:

```python
# High value - complex manual process
@workflow(time_saved=60)
async def full_onboarding(user_data: dict):
    """Complete onboarding: accounts, permissions, training, equipment."""
    ...

# Lower value - simple task
@workflow(time_saved=2)
async def update_status(ticket_id: str, status: str):
    """Update ticket status."""
    ...
```

## API Access

Query ROI data programmatically:

```python
# Via SDK (platform admin)
from bifrost import workflows

# Get workflow with ROI configured
workflow = await workflows.get("onboard_user")
print(f"Time saved: {workflow.time_saved} minutes")
```

## Reporting Periods

ROI aggregates across periods:

- **Daily**: Executions per day
- **Weekly**: Rolling 7-day totals
- **Monthly**: Calendar month totals
- **All time**: Cumulative since deployment

## Export Data

Export ROI reports for presentations:

1. Go to **Reports** > **ROI**
2. Select date range
3. Click **Export CSV**

Use exports for:
- Executive presentations
- Budget justification
- Automation ROI analysis
