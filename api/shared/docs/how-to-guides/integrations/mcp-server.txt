# MCP Server

Enable external AI tools to access Bifrost via Model Context Protocol

---

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows external AI tools to interact with Bifrost, enabling them to execute workflows, manage forms, and access platform features.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources. When enabled, Bifrost exposes an MCP server that external clients can connect to.

## Enabling MCP

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Platform**

2. Enable the **MCP Server** toggle

3. The MCP endpoint URL will be displayed

## Connecting External Clients

External AI tools like Claude Desktop can connect to the Bifrost MCP server:

1. Configure your client with the Bifrost MCP endpoint URL
2. Authenticate using your API credentials
3. The client will discover available tools automatically

For Claude Desktop, add the MCP server configuration to your Claude config file.

## Tool Availability

Tools available through MCP are determined by:

- **Agent configuration**: Tools assigned to agents are exposed via MCP
- **Workflow tools**: Workflows marked with `is_tool=True` appear as callable tools
- **System tools**: Platform capabilities like file operations and execution management

Only tools that the authenticated user has permission to access will be available.
