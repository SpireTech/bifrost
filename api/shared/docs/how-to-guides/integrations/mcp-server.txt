# MCP Server

Enable external AI tools to access Bifrost via Model Context Protocol

---

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows external AI tools to interact with Bifrost, enabling them to execute workflows, manage forms, and access platform features.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources. When enabled, Bifrost exposes an MCP server that external clients can connect to.

## Enabling MCP

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Platform**

2. Enable the **MCP Server** toggle

3. The MCP endpoint URL will be displayed

## Connecting External Clients

External AI tools like Claude Desktop can connect to the Bifrost MCP server:

1. Configure your client with the Bifrost MCP endpoint URL
2. Authenticate using your API credentials
3. The client will discover available tools automatically

For Claude Desktop, add the MCP server configuration to your Claude config file.

## Tool Availability

Tools available through MCP are determined by:

- **Agent configuration**: Tools assigned to agents are exposed via MCP
- **Workflow tools**: Workflows marked with `is_tool=True` appear as callable tools
- **System tools**: Platform capabilities like file operations and execution management

Only tools that the authenticated user has permission to access will be available.

## Available MCP Tools

### Discovery Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_workflows` | List all registered workflows |
| `get_workflow` | Get detailed metadata for a specific workflow |
| `get_workflow_schema` | Documentation about workflow decorators and structure |
| `list_data_providers` | List available data providers |
| `get_data_provider_schema` | Documentation about data provider format |
| `list_forms` | List all forms with URLs |
| `get_form_schema` | Documentation about form structure and field types |
| `list_apps` | List App Builder applications |
| `get_app` | Get detailed app definition |
| `get_app_schema` | Documentation about app structure and components |
| `list_integrations` | Show available integrations and auth status |
| `search_knowledge` | Search the Bifrost knowledge base |

### Creation Tools (Auto-Validating)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_workflow` | Create a workflow, tool, or data provider with automatic validation |
| `create_form` | Create a form with automatic schema validation |

### App Builder Tools (Granular)

Apps are managed at three levels:

**App Level:**
- `list_apps`, `get_app`, `update_app`, `publish_app`

**Page Level:**
- `create_page`, `get_page`, `update_page`, `delete_page`

**Component Level:**
- `list_components`, `create_component`, `get_component`, `update_component`, `delete_component`, `move_component`

### File Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_files` | List files and directories in workspace |
| `read_file` | Read a file from workspace |
| `write_file` | Write content to a file (for non-platform artifacts) |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file or directory |
| `search_files` | Search for text patterns across files |
| `create_folder` | Create a new folder |

### Execution Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_workflow` | Execute a workflow by ID |
| `list_executions` | List recent executions |
| `get_execution` | Get execution details and logs |

## Coding Mode Features

When using MCP with a coding-capable AI (like Claude Code), additional features are available:

### Plan/Execute Mode

The coding agent supports dynamic mode switching via `permission_mode`:

- **Plan Mode** (`plan`): Agent can read and explore but cannot make changes. Use for reviewing and planning.
- **Execute Mode** (`acceptEdits`): Agent can create and modify artifacts. Default mode.

### Task Progress

The coding agent uses the TodoWrite tool to track task progress. When enabled, you'll see:
- Persistent checklist of tasks
- Real-time status updates (pending, in progress, completed)
- Progress indicators

### Testing Workflow

The coding agent follows a mandatory testing workflow:
1. Create artifacts using creation tools (auto-validates)
2. Verify artifacts appear in list tools
3. Execute with sample data
4. Verify results match expectations
