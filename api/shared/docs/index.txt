## Built to democratize automation tooling

**Before venture capital gets the chance to own something we're all incredibly passionate about.**

Bifrost removes the limitations of traditional RPA tools while preserving the valuable abstractions - OAuth workflows, monitoring, configuration, and secret management. With multi-tenancy at its core, you can scale your Integration Services business without duplicating work across customers.

## Key Features

    
        Complete data isolation per organization. Deliver value to customers
        without code duplication or redeployment.
    
    
        Automated token refresh and credential storage. Encrypted secrets
        management.
    
    
        Python-based with full language capabilities. No proprietary syntax or
        limitations.
    
    
        Build once, use across all customers. Abstract authentication,
        pagination, and API complexity.
    
    
        Built for modern AI coding workflows. Use Claude Code, GitHub Copilot,
        and other AI tools.
    
    
        ~$10-35/month for small-to-medium workloads. No vendor lock-in or
        extractive pricing.
