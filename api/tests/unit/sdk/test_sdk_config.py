"""
Unit tests for Bifrost Config SDK module.

Note: The config SDK no longer has a dual-mode architecture.
All tests for external mode and context detection have been removed as these
internal implementation details no longer exist.

See test_sdk_platform_mode.py for platform integration tests.

# All unit tests removed - config SDK behavior is tested through integration tests
