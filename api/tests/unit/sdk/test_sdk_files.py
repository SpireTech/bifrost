"""
Unit tests for Bifrost Files SDK module.

Note: The files SDK is now API-only and no longer has local filesystem operations
or dual-mode architecture. All tests for external mode, context detection, and
path sandboxing have been removed as these internal implementation details no longer exist.

See integration tests for end-to-end file operations testing.

# All unit tests removed - files SDK behavior is tested through integration tests
