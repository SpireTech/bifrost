Unit tests for Bifrost Knowledge SDK module.

Note: The knowledge SDK no longer has a dual-mode architecture.
All tests for external mode and context detection have been removed as these
internal implementation details no longer exist.

See integration tests for end-to-end knowledge operations testing.
