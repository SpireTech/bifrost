# Docker Compose override for local Playwright testing
#
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml --profile e2e up
#
# This exposes API port 8000 to the host so local Playwright tests can connect
# through the Vite dev server proxy (which defaults to localhost:8000).
#
# Workflow:
#   Terminal 1: ./test.sh --local
#   Terminal 2: cd client && npx playwright test --headed
